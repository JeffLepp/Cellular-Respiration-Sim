# ðŸ§¬ Cell Metabolism Simulator

This project simulates core metabolic processes inside a eukaryotic cell, including:

- **Glycolysis**
- **Citric Acid Cycle (CAC / Krebs Cycle)**
- **Electron Transport Chain (ETC)**
- **ATP production & export to cytoplasm**

It models molecule transformations, energy transfers, and redox reactions using Python classes and logs all major activity through a modular logging system.
