# ðŸ§¬ Cell Metabolism Simulator

Open in VsCode or another IDE and run from cytoplasm.py in the MET3.0 folder. 
Consoles made to log state of cell are made for linux. Running on other OS' cause unhelpful terminal outputs. 

This project simulates core metabolic processes inside a eukaryotic cell, including:

- **Glycolysis**
- **Citric Acid Cycle (CAC / Krebs Cycle)**
- **Electron Transport Chain (ETC)**
- **ATP production & export to cytoplasm**

It models molecule transformations, energy transfers, and redox reactions using Python classes and logs all major activity through a modular logging system, though this is being actively developed. If you are familiar with vscode, download live server for index.html and run server.py to get more comprehensive graphs of cytoplasm and matrix states.
